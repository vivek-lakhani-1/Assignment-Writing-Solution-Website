<p className="pg9">A case study is an in-depth investigation of a single individual, group, or event. Almost all of the subject's past and present are scrutinized in order to discover any patterns or causes for their conduct.
It is possible to use case studies in a range of fields, such as psychology and medicine as well as anthropology and political science.
If we can learn from one scenario, we aim to apply the lessons learned there to other situations. Due to the inherent subjectivity of case studies, it might be difficult to extrapolate conclusions to the broader public at large
