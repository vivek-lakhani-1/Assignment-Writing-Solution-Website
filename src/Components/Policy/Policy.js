                  The kind of assignment help that we provide as a service
                  depends on the client. because we want you to get a good grade
                  on your assignment. Our experts don't leave anything out and
                  give you the best of their time, knowledge, and references.
                  But your hard work is also important if you want to get a good
                  grade. The whole tutoring process we use is set up so that
                  there are no hiccups that could cause problems with your work.
                  <br />
                  To protect the integrity of the tutoring domain, we don't
                  offer refunds outside of the situations listed in our clause.
                  We provide you with a "Digital Wallet." When you get a refund,
                  the money goes into your wallet, and you can later use that
                  money to buy a new service from us.

                <h4 className="head--one">
                  The following are scenarios when you can ask for a legitimate

                <h5 className="head--subtitle">
                  Getting a failing grade on the Assignment Service
                </h5>
                <p className="policy--para">
                  This is almost never going to happen, but if you get a failing
                  grade on the work we did for you, you can ask for a refund.
                  But for the claim, you need to send in a copy of your real
                  mark sheet or grade sheet along with your professor's
                  comments. It needs to be done within the stipulated days of
                  when you got the answer to the order you placed. The grade
                  sheet you turned in will be checked, and we'll see if the low
                  grade was because of the way we wrote or because the answer
                  you gave wasn't good enough based on your grading index and
                  how the university judged the learning outcomes. If we find
                  that the mistake was made by our experts, we will give you an
                  instant refund. The amount of the refund will be put into your
                  digital wallet.
                </p>
                <h5 className="head--subtitle">Expert's unavailability</h5>
                <p className="policy--para">
                  This isn't likely to happen, but if the expert who was
                  supposed to help you isn't available and you've already paid
                  in full for assignment help, you can ask for a change in
                  allotment.
                  <br />
                  In this case, you can place any other order for an assignment
                  that costs the same as what you have already paid for. And the
                  amount you paid will be added to your Online Assignment Expert
                  Digital Wallet, along with discounts for future purchases, for
                  the inconvenience that you will face from our end.

                <h5 className="head--subtitle">Missed Deadlines</h5>
                <p className="policy--para">
                  Well, this is something that happens only in the rarest of
                  rare cases. But if the expert misses the deadline you set and
                  can't turn in your assignment, you get your money back. When
                  you ask for a refund, our customer care will take care of the
                  refund only after the full investigation is done. Any kind of
                  assignment help is a process in which you must also take part.
                  So, if our experts ask you a question and you don't answer it
                  in a reasonable amount of time, Or, if we miss the deadline
                  because you didn't provide the necessary information, your
                  claim for a full or partial refund won't be taken into
                  account.
                  <br />
                  If the academic writer or expert takes too long to finish your
                  work, they will be held accountable. In any of these
                  situations, the decision made by our customer service team
                  about refunds will be the final one. Other areas as well, can
                  be legitimate grounds for you to ask for a refund. But we need
                  to ensure first that the grounds raised by the client are
                  reasonable and legitimate. It is only after this assurance
                  that we gain through a thorough investigation that we proceed
                  forward for the repayment of your money.

                <h4 className="head--one">Revision Policy</h4>
                <p className="policy--para">
                  Any request for changes is free as long as it is made before
                  the assignment is due and before the deadline. Beyond the
                  internal deadline, no requests for revisions can be made. In
                  such a scenario, you are held completely responsible. We know
                  that sometimes students want to make changes or aren't happy
                  with their work after the deadline of the assignment. In this
                  case, they can raise a revision inquiry by payment of a
                  nominal fee. <br />
                  We ensure that at the Assignment Writing Service that your
                  revision order after the deadline will be taken on a priority
                  basis so that you are satisfied with our service.
                  <br />
                  But we make sure that this doesn't happen frequently. Hence,
                  we ask our students to keep an eye on their work on the
                  interaction portal at Assignment Writing Service and check on
                  how their assignments are going and the status of the same.
                  Students do not need to ask for a draft as the interaction
                  portal is made in such a way that the students can see the
                  assignments being done by the experts on a live basis.
                  <br />
                  Students should not feel hesitant to ask for revisions, as at
                  Assignment Writing Service, we are happy to help.

                  The sanctity of education is something we strongly believe in,
                  and we will not tolerate anything that encourages academic
                  dishonesty. People who break our educational code of conduct
                  will face legal action.
                  <br />
                  In our academic work, we have made it obvious that we are only
                  interested in getting a better understanding of concepts and
                  making inferences. Anyone caught violating our copyrights will
                  face severe penalties from us.
                  <br />
                  Because we are a business, we are bound by a strict code of
                  ethics and will not accept any infractions of it. We will not
                  tolerate any form of transgression against our ethical
                  standards.
                  <br />
                  For the benefit of students, our researchers extensively
                  examine all of the available resources before putting them all
                  together. Our mission is to assist students in achieving their
                  academic goals while keeping tutoring costs to a minimum.
                  <br />
                  We have complete faith in our students' ability to use our
                  resources responsibly and adhere to all of our rules and
                  regulations. In order to make students' lives easier, we
                  adhere to our values of fairness and provide the best possible
                  solution to their educational issues, which we believe in.
                  Both our institution and the student must adhere to the code
                  of ethics laid out by their individual university or college.

                  Academic dishonesty has no place in our organization, and our

                  Maintaining an open and honest process while acknowledging the
