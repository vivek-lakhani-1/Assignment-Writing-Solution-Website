                  A research paper is a typical type of academic writing that
                  involves in-depth investigation and analysis. Study papers
                  demand students and academics to conduct research on a topic,
                  take a stance on that topic, and present evidence (or support)
                  for that viewpoint in a well-structured report. Some people
                  use the word "research papers" interchangeably with academic
                  articles that contain the results of original research or
                  critiques on work done by others, however, this is not always
                  the case. To be published in an academic journal, most
                  scientific publications must first be peer-reviewed by at
                  least one other researcher.
