                <p className="pg9">A dissertation is a research project that must be 
                  completed as part of an application for an undergraduate or postgraduate 
                  degree. In some countries, this term is exclusively used for the last 
                  assignments of Doctoral degrees, while in other countries the terms 
                  "thesis" and "dissertation" are equivalent. Students are typically 
                  given the opportunity to explain their findings in answer to a topic or 
                  thesis that they themselves have chosen for their dissertation. 
                  The students will be evaluated on their ability to conduct independent 
                  research, which is something they should have developed throughout their time at the institution. This evaluation will count toward the students' overall grades.
                </p>
                <p className="pg9">Even while your instructors will most likely provide you with some direction, the majority of the work on your dissertation will be done on your own. This will be the longest, hardest, and most essential assignment that the majority of students will complete throughout their time at the university. It will need months of preparation and hard effort.
                On the other hand, it has the potential to be incredibly gratifying, particularly if you have a strong interest in the subject you decide to write about. Consequently, it is unquestionably a wise decision to make sure that you pick a topic that you have a true interest in.
